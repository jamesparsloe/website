I'm an ML engineer. I like making things. I'm currently building a new startup in health.

I'm interested in ML/AI for science, generative models, and high-performance computing/parallel programming/CUDA [etc](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)

Previously:

- worked at Sonantic on text-to-speech - we were later acquired by Spotify where I worked on AI DJ, and transformers for speech generation
- worked at Squeaky - a clean energy supplier
- did algo trading on sports betting markets
- studied physics at uni
