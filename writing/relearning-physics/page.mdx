> All of physics is either impossible or trivial. It is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial.

â€” Ernest Rutherford

It's been about 10 years since I last studied physics seriously at university. I keep an interest in the subject at a popular level (YouTube, podcasts, some popular science books etc), but I'm afraid to say I've forgotten almost all non-trivial details of it from my degree.

Isolated pockets of physics and maths do remain with me (mainly the elements that overlap with machine learning or other detours I've taken), and quite a lot of the history and stories do too, but unfortunately the cohesive structure and understanding has vanished for me.

I'm not sure exactly what I will gain from studying it again, but my feeling is the tools, techniques and modes of thinking are necessary for all sorts of future technologies and innovations which I hope to be a part of and a second take can't do any harm.

An added element I have on my side this time around is computing and programming which I've been working in some capacity for the last 10 years. I think this has shaped my thoughts on the subject quite a bit, and I will definitely be trying to relearn things with some sort of computational perspective, and hopefully produce some useful byproducts along the way.
