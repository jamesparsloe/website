## Animations

I'm really liking MDX. Really simple to interleave components like this:

import Spring from "./spring";

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Spring />
</div>

and then I can just write something below it.

## Game of Life[^0]

import GameOfLife from "./game-of-life";

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <GameOfLife />
</div>

[^0]: This is a footnote


## Code highlighting

Another footnote[^1]

[^1]: This is another footnote


```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

You can then mix and match markdown codeblocks and HTML to do stuff like this:

<div className="flex justify-between space-x-4">
  <div className="w-1/2">
  <h3>Left</h3>

    ```python
    def hello(x, y):
        return x + y
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/2">
  <h3>Right</h3>
    ```python
    def world(x, y):
        return x + y
    ```
  </div>
</div>


## Quotes

> Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don’t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn’t stop you from doing anything at all.

— Richard Feynman

Lift ($$L$$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($$C_L$$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
