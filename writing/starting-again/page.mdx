Whoops, a bit of a false start there in 2020. Time to try again!

I've learnt so much from personal websites over the past couple of years that I'd like to give back what I can, and feel like I'm now in a better position to do so. At the same time, selfishly, I would like to:

- improve my writing
- meet and learn from people with similar interests and ideas
- have my own little corner of the internet

Some particular websites that I've found interesting and inspirational in the ML space:

- [James Betker](https://nonint.com/)
- [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/)
- [Paul Bridger](https://paulbridger.com/)
- [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/)

Hopefully I can emulate these to some small degree.
